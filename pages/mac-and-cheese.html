    <h2>Fall Mac and Cheese requires a special approach</h2>
     <p>This is the perfect fall Mac and Cheese recipe. It combines a beautiful cheesy flavor with a great crusty texture. I highly recommend letting most of the ingredients cool in the fridge before combining them.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ lb uncooked elbow macaroni , about 1 ½ cups</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup milk , any kind</li>
        <li>3/4 cup half and half</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees and lightly grease a square baking dish.</li>            
        <li>Cook the macaroni to al dente, according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the flour, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the milk and half and half, stirring constantly, and cook over medium-low heat for a few minutes until the mixture has thickened like the consistency of gravy. Remove from heat and stir in 1 cup shredded cheese, stirring just until melted.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked macaroni noodles and toss to coat. Pour half or the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle ½ cup cheese over the top. Add remaining pasta and sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted on top.</li>
        <li>Serve with your favorite vegetable or a side salad.</li>
        </ol>
