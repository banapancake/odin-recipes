        <p> It is time for me to talk about my favorite food of all time, pancakes! I could eat pancakes for breakfast lunch and dinner, and sometimes I actually do! Today I am going to reveal my pancake secrets so that you too can enjoy these golden cakes of deliciousness!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled off</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1½ cups milk, plus more if necessary</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for cooking</li>
        </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and milk until evenly combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the milk/egg mixture and the melted butter into the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. If the batter seems too thick, add 1 to 2 tablespoons more milk.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle or nonstick pan over medium heat; coat it lightly with vegetable oil and swirl in a thin pat of butter. Ladle or drop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately ¼ cup for each pancake; cook until the first side is golden brown, or until the top surface bubbles and is dotted with holes. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown. This happens quickly so peek after 30 seconds and watch carefully! Adjust the heat setting if necessary. Wipe the griddle clean with a paper towel between batches. Serve immediately with maple syrup.</li>
        </ol>
